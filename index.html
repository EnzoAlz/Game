    <h1 id="heading" > BRIGGGGGGGGG BRINGGGGGG. You slap your hand over the annoying alarm clock and it shuts up. Who knew waking up on a ship was so terrible. But with the new and improved Oumuamua passenger ships life is a blast. At least according to the brochure. Suddenly you hear screamign outside your quarters. It sounds like a little girl. But not just any scream, not just an annoyed kid scream, but a full on life threatning blood curdling eyebrow furrling head banging terrifying sream. You quickly jump into your on board cloaths. Do you want to investigate this scream?
