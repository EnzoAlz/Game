    <h1> Welcome traveler! You have wandered into my game. Welcome. Before you start there are a few rules you have to follow. 1, after you have used a text box and ansewered a question do not use that text box again. 2, if you die you must restart your game browser. 3, enjoy yorself! This is a browser game made by a student. Just enjoy playing and have fun.</h1>
</head>
<!--Below is the hardest part for me. In this section of my code is where everything starts to work. This part reads the inputs to each text box and adds to the text accordingly. Instead of giving the player 2 options and doubling my work I just made it so if anything else is said it will be counted as as else. I still give the 2 options clearly as not to confuse the player. -->
<!-- I quickly figured out how to do the below part because I was worried about the time I had left to finish the game. Because of this I will add more to the website like possibly music, images or a longer story. As well I used mostly inline css because I find it easiest to work with and understand.-->
<!--This is just to explain the game.-->
