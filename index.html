    <h1 id="heading" >In front of you are 2 doors. There is a red door and a blue door. You hear a young man scream behind the red door. It is a blood curdling scream that makes your blood boil. Behind the red door you ear soft laughter. Laughter like a thousand people in one space in time. The kind of laugh that goes on forever with no end in sight. Tell me the color of door you want to open.
