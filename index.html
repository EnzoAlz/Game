Slowly the door opens revealing a pitch black room.'h-hello? Is anyone there?' you stamer. But you hear nothing. You slowly step into the room and reach for the light switch. Suddenly you feel your hand ripped away from you. The little girl grabs for your throat with claw like hands. But this is not little girl. She sweeps your feet from under and catches you off guard.
